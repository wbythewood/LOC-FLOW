#### INSTALL
1. cd to src directory, run
	> python software_download.py
This downloads FDTCC, GrowClust, MatchLocate2, Phasenet, REAL. I did not have to make any changes to this code.

2. download Hypoinverse from https://www.usgs.gov/software/hypoinverse-earthquake-location. 
This downloads hyp1.40.tar. Untar it. 

3. I don't have wget, so I had to download hypodd separately: http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~felixw/HYPODD/HYPODD_1.3.tar.gz
This downloads hypodd1.3.tar. Untar it. 

4. Go into each of these directories to compile the codes. If you don't have gcc-9, download it. I used
	> brew install gcc@9
I also had to add the following to my .zshrc file, though I don't recall exactly why:
export SDKROOT=`xcrun --show-sdk-path`

	FDTCC/src
		make had no issues with the above modifications.

	GrowClust/SRC
		make had no issues here

	HYPODD/src
		I don't have g77 or f77, so have replaced them with gfortran in the following places:
		hista2ddsta/Makefile
		hypoDD/Makefile
		ncsn2pha/Makefile
		ph2dt/Makefile

		In each of these Makefiles, I've commented out other FCs, and added:
			FC = gfortran
		This generates lots of warnings, but no errors when you go back to HYPODD/src and make.

	MatchLocate2/src
		There were issues with compiling. Solved by changing gcc-10 to gcc-9 in line 3 of Makefile

	Phasenet is all python, no compiling here.

	REAL/SRC has multiple subfolders:
		REAL
			change line 2 of makefiule from gcc-10 to gcc-9
		VELEST
			make had no issues here
		pick2real
			make had no issues here

	hyp1.40/source
		line 16, comment out the cp command
		I had to replace every g77 with gfortran. This is easy with vim:
			:%s/g77/gfortran/g
		With these changes, everything compiles. 

5. back to the upper src directory, run
	> bash run_install.sh

6. change directory cd ../bin, pwd, then copy this directory and add it to your path in ~/.zshrc
